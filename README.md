# jc3mp_classic_minimap
A package for Nano's JC3MP mod - The JC2 minimap with a JC3 theme

Config:
ui_position: 0 = Top Left, 1 = Top Right, 2 = Bottom Right, 3 = Bottom Left (Top Right by default)
ui_scale: 0 = Small, 1 = Large (Small by default)
update_health: milliseconds between each poll to the server for player health (250 by default)
update_pos: milliseconds between position update (clientside, 100 by default)

I'll make this look pretty soon(ish)
